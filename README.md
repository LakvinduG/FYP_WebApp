# FYP_WebApp
## Project Overview
This Flutter web application is the **frontend** of a Food Waste, Health & Safety Management system aimed at manufacturers and companies.  

The web app allows users to:
- View and manage **product information** associated with their company.
- Access **manufacturing batch information** including batch IDs, manufacturing dates, and QR codes.
- Add new **products** or **batches** via interactive dialogs.
- Navigate between **Product Information** and **Manufacturing Information** screens seamlessly.
- Ensure data integrity and organization by linking products and batches to specific companies.

The application communicates with a **backend API** to fetch, update, and store data securely.
